                Project based tutoring is effectively an "unlimitted tutoring
                plan". We have sessions as often as possible with time for
                homework in between. The total amount is due upfront. You may
                also pay in 3 installments with an additional 5% convenience
                fee: 20 percent upfront, 40% after the first 20 tutoring hours,
                and the rest after the next 20 tutoring hours.
              </p>

                If you start with hourly sessions, book less than 30 hours, and
                later switch to Project Based tutoring, you will recieve a
                pro-rated price.
